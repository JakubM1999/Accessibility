<h1>Inclusive Design vs. Universal Design</h1>
<p>It all boils down to improving the user experience. Universal design takes a one size fits all approach. When utilizing universal design, UX designers may find themselves looking for the ‘average user’ of the product and end up meeting the needs and wants of an imaginary person. While more time and resource-consuming, inclusive design forces designers to innovate and communicate with their target audience and see what they want and need in a product. Universal design can be a stepping stone for many early-stage projects. But it’s limited in its reach, especially with both digital and physical markets becoming more diverse and global than ever before. Finding ways to serve all potential users regardless of their demographic or background can result in an improved user experience. Universal design might force UX designers to categorize anyone who doesn’t fit within the box of an ‘average user’ as an ‘edge case,’ resulting in them ignoring their needs. On the other hand, inclusive design accommodates both the average user and people with unique circumstances. While inclusive design is the best practice for UX designers, it comes with its own challenges. Since there isn’t a one-size-fits-all solution and there usually aren’t previous applications they can use for guidance or inspiration, UX designers would have to start from scratch with every new product. Inclusive design is more time, energy, and resource-intensive, but it makes up for its shortcomings by resulting in products with the greatest numbers of potential users. Inclusively designed products are also open to adaptation and only require occasional small tweaks instead of complete redesigns.</p>

<p>In this assignment I wanned to create a simple website that describes every aspect of a good accessibility-friendly website. That way I could also show that I understand "ARIA" and some of it's components, you can see that by checking out the code or turning on the screen/text reader.</p>
<p>After that I created a figma file where you can see the demonstartions of some accessibility-friendly plugins that can help you with making the design on your website more accessible. By checking your contrast and testing out colors on your web site with color blindness pluing.</p>

<p> Last but not least I wrote some diffrences between inclusive design and universal design this topic is a bit diverced but they are similar with that, that both sides are trying to make design plesent for everybody.</p>

<p>Overall I feel like I accomplished skills and knowledge that I needed to, and I feel confident with these projects that I made. Of Course there are probably some mistakes that I made. Hope you like it :)</p>
