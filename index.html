            <p>
            What is accessible design ? It is a design that was created to
            be accessible to all people. This design is a process in which the
            needs of people with disabilities are specifically considered,
            sometimes refers to the characteristic that products, services,
            and facilities can be independently used by people with a variety
            of disabilities. But how inportant is the accessibility in web design?
            By making your website accessible, you are ensuring that all of 
            your potential users, including people with disabilities,
            have a decent user experience and are able to easily access your information.
            By implementing accessibility best practices, you are also improving the usability
            of the site for all users.

    <section class="aboutTextSize" role="region" aria-label="What text sizing means in accessible design">
        <h2 class="subTitle" >Text sizing in accessible design</h2>
            <p>
            Text is crucial for web accessibility. It’s perhaps the only website
            element that screen readers can actually “read.” Not all fonts are
            designed for web accessibility. That’s why it pays to stick to typefaces
            that are accessibility-friendly, such as Tahoma, Calibri, Helvetica,
            Arial, Verdana, and Times New Roman. It’s a no-brainer that you need
            to use a decent size font on your website to make it easy for the reader.

    <section class="aboutColors" role="region" aria-label="Colors in accessible design">
        <h2 class="subTitle">Colors in accessible design</h2>
            <p>
            making colors accessible usually means creating color combinations that
            provide enough contrast that the content is clearly distinguishable
            from the surrounding page. Colors that is best to avoid are red and black
            combinations, People who cannot detect red will confuse red and black,
            so the item will not be legible.

    <section class="aboutContrast" role="region" aria-label="Contrast in accessible design">
        <h2 class="subTitle">Contrast in accessible design</h2>
            <p>
            Color contrast refers to the difference in light between font
            (or anything in the foreground) and its background. By using sufficiently-contrasting
            colors, a website's font visibility is stark enough to distinguish that means that the great
            content you've developed for your website can be read by everyone.

    <section class="aboutAltTags" role="region" aria-label="Alt tags in accessible design">
        <h2 class="subTitle">Alt tags in accessible design</h2>
            <p>
            Alt tags are very important in the code when you are putting in pictures,
            because when blind or just disable person has the screen/text reader on and they
            come across picture that you putted in they will just hear "image name, unlabelled image"
            but they're not going to know of what is the picture exactly so it's good
            to use alt tags to describe what it is on the picture. Here is a example
            if you use screen/text reader on this two pictures you can hear that the first
            picture to the left has no alt tag but the other one to the right does.
            </p>
        <div class="picContainer">
            <img class="pic1" src="img/img3.JPG">
            <img class="pic1" src="img/img3.JPG" alt="Picture of a moon above mountains">
        </div>

    <section class="aboutCode" role="region" aria-label="Code in accessible design">
        <h2 class="subTitle">Code in accessible design</h2>
            <p>
            This is the conclusion of what I wrote on this page above, in the code it is important
            to use the tags that were ment to be used in verious circumstances for example
            when you are making navbar use tak "nav" when you are making a button use tag "button"
            because if we don't, people with disabilities that can't see for example won't
            know what is "group, signup" insted they would hear "button, signup" the same goes
            to alt tags in the images as I demonstarated erlier, So it is important to write
            currect code so others can understand what's happening on the website that we created.
